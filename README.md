# Input Device Indicator

This app is an indicator to help you disable/enable input devices (such as keyboards, mouses and trackpads).

## How to Use

You just need to invoke `input-device-indicator`. (We do want to be able to 
invoke it from a menu item or a launcher when pressing Super but we did not 
manage to do it so far. Any help is welcome.)

Once activated, there will be an icon (a cat on a keyboard) on your indicators.
Click on it and a list of devices will appear. Just click on the one you want
to disable or enable:

For those more used to technicalities, it can be useful to know this indicator
is basically a wrapper around
[`xinput`](https://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man1/xinput.1.xhtml): the
devices come from the output of `xinput list --long`, and we disable/enable
them with `xinput disable`/`xinput enable`.

## Why?

Because of this:
